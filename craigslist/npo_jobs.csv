You:

You’re more than capable. You’re the one your teammates talk about in hushed tones. “How did he/she DO that?!?” “Is that even possible!?!”

You’re able to make things work when others crumble under the pressure. You’re beyond just being “motivated” or a “self-starter”. We know that when we toss you the keys you’re going to excel and exceed our expectations. Because that’s what you do.

You’re a grown up. You know how to hit your deadlines, and stay in touch when things get tricky. You’re a professional. You don’t need us to babysit you or tie your shoes. You’ll be telecommuting, and you’ll handle that responsibility like a champ.

Oh, and you know how to communicate too. Because it’s better to say “No” right now, than it is to say “Yes” and screw something up six months down the line because you were afraid to speak your truth.

Us: 

We’re the employer you dreamed about while you were in college. Yep, we “get” you. We’ll recognize your wins, and reward you for them. We’ll help coach you past your weak points. We all have them. And we’re okay if you’re able to help us find our weak points too. We’re secretly hoping to find a new best friend and growth partner.

If you’re capable and you have the personality to help us drive this thing forward instead of us having to drag you, we want to have a conversation. Send a resume, and do it quick, before somebody else does.

PS- Let me repeat. PLEASE have a personality. You’ll find us a charming, fun environment to work and grow. If you’re capable, we’ll be your biggest cheerleaders and help drive you to every success. 

PPS- We also need you to have some relevant experience.

Namely:

Proven working experience in technical writing of software documentation

Ability to deliver high quality documentation paying attention to detail

Ability to quickly grasp complex technical concepts and make them easily understandable in text and pictures

Basic familiarity with the SDLC and software development

Standardize documentation for layout, style, and language, and create templates and scripts to automate as possible.

Work with project teams to create documentation for diverse groups.

Track revisions and edits, and maintain files.

Review and improve formatting and visual components, and specifications.

Familiarity with Adobe Design Suite CS6 (Illustrator, InDesign, PhotoShop)

Familiarity with style guides such as AP Stylebook, Chicago Manual of Style, and
Microsoft Manual of Style/Technical Publications 

Ability to work directly with engineering documents – specifications, test plans, diagrams, schematics, and so on.

University degree in Computer Science, Engineering or equivalent preferred

The adage of ""It's who you know, not what you know"" really is difficult to reconcile when you feel like you have no network to get to your next career step.

Over the past 12 years, I heard this advice a lot as I moved around from city to city—both in the US and abroad. With every move, I had to rebuild my network, and it was *really* difficult each time.

If you're someone who's ever experienced a life transition, like a career change, having a child, or deciding to return to work after taking an extended leave, then this story is probably all too familiar.

If you're a woman, minority, or person with a non-traditional background which, when combined, represents the majority of the U.S. population, then it's *really* difficult to make any change because people already have these preconceived notions about you.

It's not an excuse, but an acknowledgment that biases are our reality.

Our reality is harsh on the job search. And we all could use help in fending off common biases in our job search so we can overcome the challenges we face in our transitions.

That's why we built JobFit - to help people in transition broaden the ""who you know,"" so you can show them your ""what you know."" We primarily assist people who are interested in transitioning to a new city for their next career step.

Whether you want to move for family, a change of scenery, or better opportunities, our goal is to help people find job referrals in cities where they want to work.

Find any job referral for any specific job to any particular company.

Our process of applying for job referrals is simple.

1. Find a company where you want a job referral.
2. Anonymously answer a few questions on what interested you about the company. Anonymity is to protect you from bias against your location, among other hiring bias.
3. A non-recruiter employee at the company will review your answers. If the employee likes your responses, they gain access to your name and resume for the job referral.


Here are some job referrals you can directly start connecting to right away:

For a job referral to DroneDeploy - https://formyreferral.getjobfit.com/MXBH7tBNl1?utm_source=craigslist&utm_medium=software_qa_dba_etc&utm_campaign=boston&utm_term=dronedeploy%2C%20v1&utm_content=sponsor_link

For a job referral to Intel - https://formyreferral.getjobfit.com/Db5XfR1HKZ?utm_source=craigslist&utm_medium=software_qa_dba_etc&utm_campaign=boston&utm_term=intel%2C%20v1&utm_content=sponsor_link

We have resources to get you more job referrals to anywhere you want. You can explore other jobs in the remaining 70,000 companies in our network. Don't let your location limit your goals. You can even find job referrals for remote jobs if you wish.
